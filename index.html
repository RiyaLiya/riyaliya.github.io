<h3 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(2, 2, 84);"><U><i>RECAP!</i></u></h3>
<p>                                                                         </p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(2, 2, 84);"><p><u>Before i confessed</u></p></h4>
    <p>So in early october 2024/late september 2024, we started talking for the first time. You were hesitant at first and was unsure if me and you should be friends but u eventually realised im a chill guy and became friends with me </p>
<p>We first talked about Nadim and as i talked to you i eventually found out ur a really cool and good person that i lowkey want to be friends with.
    after that, i saw u after school and went to you and you noticed a girl laughing at me from across the street and you told me, i then told you she is my sister and u said oh okay. I went home and texted u to not tell anyone shes my sister. this is how we first started becoming friends </p>
<p>we talked everyday from then on. Flash forward to culture day of 2024 where i helped you choose your culture day clothes and let you put ur books in my bag (u forgot them for the whole holiday)</p>
<p>On culture day i saw you in the morning after form and oh my i still remember the feeling of peace and happiness i felt by watching u, as you were putting ur books in my bag i felt everything around me fall silent and i could only hear youre cute little giggles</p>
<p>From then on i knew i wanted to try my best to have a future with you in it!</p>
<p>Then we only got closer and closer to the point where everyone but us said we were dating including all of our friends it is so funny now that i look back on it</p>
<p>we became genuine best friends by early/mid-January of 2025 where we used to call every single day for no reason and just talk for ages. And we still have screenshots of those 10 hour calls</p>
<p>Then by late january we sent so many cute romantic tiktoks to eachother while still being "just friends" it is actually hilarious baby!!</p>
<p>then on February 5th 2025 i confessed my feelings to you while you were drying your hair in your brothers room and i was in the hospital lmaooo</p>
<p>when you also confessed back and the feelings were mutual i felt so relieved even though i knew you liked me but that feeling is unbeatable. the way my heart was beating and i was so nervous i was shaking and sweating</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(2, 2, 84);"><p>HI ITS FEBRUARY 5TH HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BUBBAAAA!!!! I LOVE YOU SOOOOO MUCH RIYA!!!!</p></h1>

<h4 style="color: rgb(2, 2, 84);"><p><u>After i confessed</u></p></h4>
<p>After that we became even closer however my injury limited it, but we still got veryyy close through out the first 3-4 months</p>
<p>BUT after 3-4 months our first ever issues were rising, i dont want to go into detail because its in the past and we overcame it together and thats the point of it all</p>
<p> i am genuinely so proud of us and you because we got past this stage of our relationship even when it felt like we couldnt, i am really really happy bubba</p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(2, 2, 84);"><p><u>DATEESSS!!</u></p></h4>
<ul>
    <li><p>in the summer holidays we had our first ever date of both of our lives !!!!!!! it was soooo scary for both of us, we wore red and dark blue jeans and we had so much fun at bowling and when we were eating i loved it so much</p></li>
    <li><p>Then we had our second date in the park where we wore blue and white, we ate at that restaurant and got pizza and lasagna and ice scream at the start of the date</p></li>
    <li><p>the walk from the park to the restaurantwas my favourite part, when i picked you up and put u on the wall and we were sooo intimate there and we even made a tiktok too. On that wall was soooo vute i loved it and even on the bench at the prk you stood in between my legsni loved it </p></li>
    <li><p>Our third date was on your birthday, we went town and i got your nails done, you took me to corn exchange where we went to literally every single shop, it was genuinely so so fun apart from that horrible restaurant we ate at lmao</p></li>
    <li><p>our fourth date was aggeesssss after inthe december holidays where we went ice skating it was soooo funny i still smile or laugh when i remember it, we were so bad but we still had so much fun because we were together, we unfortunately couldnt eat together that day since we were running late but we did get to eat corndog and do some shopping, w also went on the ferris wheel which was fun and cute i liked it</p></li>
    <li><p>our fifth date was when we went to the lloyds banking thing, this date is most likely my favourite, we did a productive thing and we turned it into a date.
             we had so much fun in the photobooth <!--i touched and played with your boobs and you loved it-->;) we spent sooo long. And then the food that we gotthat day hollyyy it was sooooooo good no joke best meal ive ever had it was amazingnggnggggggg.
